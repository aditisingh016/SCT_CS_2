# SCT_CS_2
# 🔐 Image Encryption & Decryption Tool

A beginner-friendly Python project to encrypt and decrypt images using:

- XOR Encryption 🔁
- Pixel Swapping 🔄

It provides a simple command-line interface where users can encrypt or decrypt any image using the selected method. The tool is ideal for experimenting with basic cryptographic operations on image data.

### 🛠️ Built With
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### 🚀 How to Run (on Replit or Locally)
1. Upload any image as `tiger.png` (or change in code)
2. Run `main.py`
3. Choose your option from the menu:
   - 1: XOR Encrypt
   - 2: Swap Encrypt
   - 3: XOR Decrypt
   - 4: Swap Decrypt
4. Encrypted/Decrypted images will be saved and displayed.
